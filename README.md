# Brainfuck 

A small [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter written in C++.

# Usage

To run the repl, simple run `brainfuck.exe` with no arguments. If you'd like to pass the interpreter a source file, simply add it as an argument to the program.

As an example, if you wanted to run `hello_world.bf` from the test files, simply use `./brainfuck.exe ./test/hello_world.bf`.

# Building

On Windows with clang installed, simply run ```./build.bat``` to build.
